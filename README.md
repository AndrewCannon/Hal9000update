# Hal9000update
I started from [Adafruits Hal9000 tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/hal-9000-rp2040-prop-maker) and added some more components and capabilities.

New components include: 
1) A 3d printed base for support and housing the additional parts
2) [PIR sensor](https://thepihut.com/products/breadboard-friendly-mini-pir-motion-sensor-with-3-pin-header) I had from a [pihut kit](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/maker-advent-calendar-day-7-monitoring-motion)
3) [LEDs and resistors](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/maker-advent-calendar-day-2-let-s-get-blinky)

I added code to use the PIR sensor, accelorameter, LEDs and use different button push lengths to use different sound files.
